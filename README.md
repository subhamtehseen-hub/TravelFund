TravelFund – Group Travel Budget & Expense Manager
Project Overview
TravelFund is a responsive single-page web application designed to help groups manage travel budgets and split expenses fairly.
Users can create multiple trips, add participants for each trip, record expenses, and instantly see equal-split balances. A settlement summary modal shows who should pay or receive money.

This project is built as a clean frontend prototype using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript.
